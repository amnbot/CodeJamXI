[StoryHolic](https://storyholic.netlify.app/) is a submission in CodeJam XI by team NDL, made up of two McGill University Students:

In StoryHolic, the user can create the first scene of a story, limited to 500 characters, and upload it. Upon searching for it, other users can create a "branch" of that story, which is a scene that serves as a continuation to the original story. A given scene may be branched by multiples users and multiples times. Hence, one story may have many different outcomes.
